# misc--backgammon-ending
Simulation of endings to the game of backgammon with two different rule sets. To maybe prove point to my friends...


My friends and I had a debate about the ending of backgammon. There are two rules that affect the finish.
1) to take a counter home, you have to roll the exact number of spaces to the home, i.e. if it's 1 space from home you have to roll a 1.
2) to take a counter home, you have to roll at least the number of spaces to home, i.e. if it's 1 space from home you can roll any number, or if 2 spaces a roll of 2 or above is good.

I said that rule 2 should be used, not to mention because it's the official rule, because rule 1 disadvantages people who get to the end phase first. 
It means that you get stuck with a few counters on position 1 and 2 waiting to roll 1s and 2s to take them home.
This allows players with worse strategy during the game to catch up.
In short: you are more likely to be able to win from behind when using rule 1.

As it turns out, as someone who is behind at the end, you are not more likely to win with rule 1. The likelihood is the same in either case - at least under the assumptions I have made in this code. This is because both players face the same obstacles to take their counters home when they get there. 
Probably it was just a confirmation bias on my side that made me think that while playing.

So... in the end had no evidence to persuade my friends that their use of rule 1 was unfair. Sad.
